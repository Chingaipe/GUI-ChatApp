# GUI-ChatApp
This is a simple java GUI chat app that was developed with the Object Client Server Framework (OCSF).

OCSF is a Java framework that can be used to develop client-server systems. This framework is called OCSF to reflect the fact that
the client-server systems built using this framework will exchange Java objects. It is therefore strongly object-oriented as all the
lower-level communication layers are encapslated inside the framework. The OCSF license can be found at www.lloseng.com and for more info on OCSF visit https://goo.gl/EZJMXY

Basically it has two 2 sides; 
  Server - this handles all requests from the client these include connection requests and forwarding messages .
  Client - enables the client to connect to the server and send messages.
